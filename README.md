Tetra-Irrlicht-Framework
========================

Simple (unfinished, barebones) framework built using Irrlicht/Irrklang in C++.
Originally built for an unofficial sequel to Legend of Dragoon, but has since 
been abandoned.  This is a very early development build that was saved.  The 
latest builds were lost when the repo~ that was hosting them was shutdown.
